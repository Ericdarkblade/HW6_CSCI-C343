**Assignment** **structure**

You will have one make-up assignment at the end of the semester. We will provide starter code in the form of a zip file here and you must not change anything that isn't marked with a TODO. You are free to use helper functions but do not change any function headers. If you think that something is an error, please ask in InScribe and we will take a look. Please submit your work to the Autograder that we will link and set up. Before the due date, you will have access to the Autograder where you can get immediate feedback about possible errors in your code. Note that passing the tests on the Autograder does not guarantee correctness of your code and also note that you can only use the Autograder a limited number of times, so make each submission worth it. 

80% of your total grade is the accuracy in which your code passes these test suites. 20% of your grade is based upon the test cases you submit on canvas as well. Be sure to read the assignment page/document thoroughly. 

We will not accept late work beyond 1 day. You get an extra 24 hours with a 10% deduction and then after we will no longer accept it unless you have some extension granted by Professor Ashraf.

This assignment will focus on the implementation of Tries using HashMaps. You will also continue to use your own implemented data structure to complete an autocomplete feature. 

Your tasks are to implement all the methods marked with TODO and write test cases checking for accuracy (all methods marked)/efficiency (of the ones we specifically ask). Include edge cases. Be sure to implement these tests using JUnit.

Please feel free to use BufferedReader or some other Java import to read any files necessary.
